# alx-backend-storage - Redis Basics

Welcome to the Redis Basics section of the alx-backend-storage repository. This section contains a Python script named `exercise.py` showcasing the basics of working with Redis, an open-source, in-memory data structure store.

## Introduction

Redis is a high-performance, NoSQL, key-value store known for its speed and versatility. It is commonly used for caching, real-time analytics, messaging, and more. The `exercise.py` script in this repository provides examples that demonstrate fundamental Redis operations.

## Program Descriptions

Explore the [exercise.py](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-storage/blob/main/0x02-redis_basic/exercise.py) Python script to learn about Redis and its basic usage.

## Compiling and Executing

To run the `exercise.py` script in this section, make sure you have Redis installed and running locally or on a remote server. Install the required Python libraries using `pip` if necessary. Then, execute the script using Python 3:

```bash
python3 exercise.py
```

Ensure that you modify the connection details (host, port) in the script as needed to match your Redis configuration.
